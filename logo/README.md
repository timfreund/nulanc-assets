# Neighbors United Logos

We support two logo variants.  Our default logo for use anywhere is
named `logo-master`.  A print ready SVG file is at
[./logo-master.svg](./logo-master.svg) and a rendered PNG image for
web profiles is at [./rendered/logo-master.png](./rendered/logo-master.png).

We also support a logo that can be rendered as a circle like the new
Twitter avatars.  A print ready SVG file is at
[./logo-circle-avatar.svg](./logo-circle-avatar.svg) and a rendered
PNG image for web profiles is at
[./rendered/logo-circle-avatar.png](./rendered/logo-circle-avatar.png).

We prefer the square format but allow the use of the circle format
when the square format would literally be a square peg in a round
hole.
